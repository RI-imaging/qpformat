0.4.3
 - fix: "identifier" not always set for generated instances of QPImage
0.4.2
 - fix: implement `get_name` method for SeriesFolder format
 - enh: start identifier/name indexing at 1 instead of 0
0.4.1
 - fix: do not allow intensity values less than zero for SingleTifPhasics
0.4.0
 - feat: extract meta data from QPSeries/QPImage data files
0.3.5
 - fix: single_tif_phaiscs (SID4Bio) contains two phase images, the second
   of which is recorded at a different time point than the intensity
   image. The first image is recorded in wavelengths and not in
   nanometers and thus is converted using phasics metadata first.
   If this metadata is not available, the second image is used.
0.3.4
 - fix: qpimage file formats: override identifiers (clean solution)
 - fix: add check for valid meta_data keys
 - docs: document attributes of SeriesData
0.3.3
 - fix: qpimage file formats: identifiers were not unique, but simply
   copied from the input hdf5 file
0.3.2
 - setup: add qpimage version dependency
0.3.1
 - ci: automate PyPI release with travis-ci
0.3.0

 - fix: SeriesHdf5Qpimage blocked hdf5 file for reading
 - fix: background datasets did not get hologram keyword arguments
 - feat: allow to cast input data type (qpimage version 0.2.0)
0.1.6
 - code cleanup
0.1.5
 - fix: raw phasics tif files were not ignored in `SeriesFolder` (#3)
 - feat: reduce length of dataset hashes to six chars for user convenience
 - feat: switch order of name and index in identifier for user convenience
0.1.4
 - feat: new file format for zipped hologram tif files
 - feat: add "storage_type" property describing which type of data
   is stored originally in a dataset
 - feat: add hologram file formats: HyperSpy and tif-based 
 - fix: use hologram keyword arguments to generate dataset identifer

 - feat: implement SeriesData.saveh5 (export as qpimage.QPSeries) (#2)
 - feat: add unique part of file name to SeriesFolder image identifiers (#2)
 - feat: extract identifiers from hdf5 files
0.1.1
