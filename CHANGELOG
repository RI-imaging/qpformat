0.4.0
 - feat: extract meta data from QPSeries/QPImage data files
0.3.5
 - fix: single_tif_phaiscs (SID4Bio) contains two phase images, the second
   of which is recorded at a different time point than the intensity
   image. The first image is recorded in wavelengths and not in
   nanometers and thus is converted using phasics metadata first.
   If this metadata is not available, the second image is used.
0.3.4
 - fix: qpimage file formats: override identifiers (clean solution)
 - fix: add check for valid meta_data keys
 - docs: document attributes of SeriesData
0.3.3

   copied from the input hdf5 file
