0.10.1
 - fix: SeriesHdf5Qpimage did not correctly load meta data "time"
0.10.0
 - feat: allow to specify a time interval or a series slice in
   SeriesData.saveh5
 - fix: seek to zero before computing a data identifier for an
   io.IOBase object
 - fix: only write series identifier in SeriesData.saveh5 if
   the keyword arguments for slice extraction are not set
 - ref: fix deprecated `.value` (h5py)
 - tests: fix date extraction from zip file
0.9.0
 - feat: allow to specify a slice in SeriesData.saveh5 (useful
   when only a specific region needs to be extracted)
0.8.0
 - feat: allow tracking the progress of SeriesData.saveh5 using
   multiprocessing.Value objects
0.7.1
 - docs: fix missing changelog files
0.7.0
 - feat: added command-line entry point "qpinfo"
 - feat: support subjoined QPSeries file format
 - docs: minor update
0.6.4
 - fix: ignore None or nan values in given meta data
0.6.3
 - enh: introduce BadFileFormatError
0.6.2
 - maintenance release
0.6.1
 - tests: fix bad identification of data types
0.6.0
 - BREAKING CHANGE: SeriesFolder file format does not load data files
   recursively anymore
0.5.1
 - fix: falsely detected datasets in SeriesFolder file format
0.5.0
 - feat: use file modification time as fallback for TIFF files when
   the file format does not implement `get_time`
 - fix: return "nan" instead of "0" when the time is not defined for
   a measurement
0.4.4
 - fix: SeriesFolder file format should not support folders containing
   no usable data
 - fix: verify file format given by user
0.4.3
 - fix: "identifier" not always set for generated instances of QPImage
0.4.2
 - fix: implement `get_name` method for SeriesFolder format
 - enh: start identifier/name indexing at 1 instead of 0
0.4.1
 - fix: do not allow intensity values less than zero for SingleTifPhasics
0.4.0
 - feat: extract meta data from QPSeries/QPImage data files
0.3.5
 - fix: single_tif_phaiscs (SID4Bio) contains two phase images, the second
   of which is recorded at a different time point than the intensity
   image. The first image is recorded in wavelengths and not in
   nanometers and thus is converted using phasics metadata first.
   If this metadata is not available, the second image is used.
0.3.4
 - fix: qpimage file formats: override identifiers (clean solution)
 - fix: add check for valid meta_data keys
 - docs: document attributes of SeriesData
0.3.3
 - fix: qpimage file formats: identifiers were not unique, but simply
   copied from the input hdf5 file
0.3.2
 - setup: add qpimage version dependency
0.3.1
 - ci: automate PyPI release with travis-ci
0.3.0
 - docs: automatically document all file format classes
 - docs: add introduction and file format overview
 - tests: improve coverage
0.2.1
 - fix: regression when loading data from zip file
0.2.0
 - drop support for Python 3.5
 - fix: SeriesHdf5Qpimage blocked hdf5 file for reading
 - fix: background datasets did not get hologram keyword arguments
 - feat: allow to cast input data type (qpimage version 0.2.0)
0.1.6
 - code cleanup
0.1.5
 - fix: raw phasics tif files were not ignored in `SeriesFolder` (#3)
 - feat: reduce length of dataset hashes to six chars for user convenience
 - feat: switch order of name and index in identifier for user convenience
0.1.4
 - feat: new file format for zipped hologram tif files
 - feat: add "storage_type" property describing which type of data
   is stored originally in a dataset
 - feat: add hologram file formats: HyperSpy and tif-based 
 - fix: use hologram keyword arguments to generate dataset identifer
0.1.3
 - feat: save memory by hard-linking background image data in QPSeries
 - fix: format series and single hdf5: override raw meta data
 - fix: include background data in determination of data set identifiers

 - feat: implement SeriesData.saveh5 (export as qpimage.QPSeries) (#2)
 - feat: add unique part of file name to SeriesFolder image identifiers (#2)
 - feat: extract identifiers from hdf5 files
